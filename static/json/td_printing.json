    "description":"After some time of thinking about it, I decided to try 3D modeling even though I was never an artistic person. I took a Udemy course in Solidworks and after some time of playing and modeling with it, I decided to buy the Ender 3. I build an enclosure for it, replaced the nozzle with an all-metal swizz nozzle, and the heating bed. The printer now prints PETG, ABS, and practically every material out there.<br/> <b>The second picture here is one of my first prints. It is Gandalf's Staff From lord of the ring printed with wood fabric PLA and I add LED lights with a control button.</b>",
