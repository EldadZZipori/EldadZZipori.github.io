    "description":"Member of the Electrical sub-team in the Mars Colony Design team at UBC. Currently working on the Sabatier Reactor. In the team, I have learned how to use Altium Designer and PCB design and contribute to the team's research on starting vials, shift registers, and relay. I also helped solder the circuits we designed and test their functionality. Currently working on building an RTOS for our circuits and main Arduino.<br/><a href='https://ubcmarscolony.wordpress.com/'>Mars Colony Design Team Web Site</a>",
