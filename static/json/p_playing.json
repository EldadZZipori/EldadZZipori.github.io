    "description":"At the age of fourteen I decided I have to give playing the piano another chance. After failing at a younger age I have went back to my last teacher. Since than I have been studing and practicing piano playing. I played and am playing complex pieces such as: Toccate in D minor by J.S. Bach, Waltz In B Minor by Frederic Chopin, Solfeggio by C.P.E Bach and many more. It is one of my favorite hobbies and it is my gateway to the world outside technology. ",
